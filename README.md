# Fish Store - Online Fish Shop

Fish Store is an online shop project built with React, TypeScript, Redux, Redux Toolkit with slices, and Webpack. It allows users to browse and purchase a variety of fish products. The project includes a fish slider, individual fish items with weight and price, fish recipes, and a shopping cart feature. The recipes are associated with the fish items and can be viewed in a modal window, and upon clicking, it opens a recipe page with step-by-step instructions. Users can add fish items to their cart, adjust the quantity of each item, and view the total price of the selected products. When users proceed to the checkout, a modal window displays the selected items and the total price. After completing the purchase, users can return to the main shop page.
